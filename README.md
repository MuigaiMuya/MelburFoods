<h1>Melbur Foods</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<b>Melbur Foods</b> is a division of <i>Melbur Ventures Ltd</I>, a registered company in Kenya. At Melbur Foods, Studios, we pride ourselves in selling healthy flours, edible seeds, powders and spices, dried fruits and nuts. We believe you have to incorporate these products in your daily meal, given our eating habits and prevailing health conditions.

The project being undertaken was a landing site, almost similar to the existing division's website (https://foods.melbur.co.ke), which would mimic the e-commerce properties of the website. It would therefore show our products, their variations and prices, and customers would then place an order which would then be followed up with and fulfilled. 

The project was the Webstack - Portfolio Project for ALX, used as the final project required in the Front-End Specialization for their Software Engineering course.
